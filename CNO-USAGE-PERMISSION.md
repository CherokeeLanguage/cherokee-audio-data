    ᎣᏏᏲ Mr Boney,
    
    Tim ᏕᏣᏙᎠ.  [http://cherokeedictionary.net](http://cherokeedictionary.net/) ᏗᎫᎪᏔᏂᏙᎯ.
    I downloaded the We Are Learning Cherokee zip file from the site.
    I didn't know if there were any usage rules about the audio.
    For example, I took the audio and made Berlitz-style recordings.
    An example would be where the phrase is spoken in English then the Cherokee audio followed
    by a 3-second pause and the Cherokee portion is played three times.
    I wanted to take the audio I produced and either put it on the Cherokee Dictionary online
    site or share it on social media with attribution to where it came from (for free).
    However, I am unsure of the copyright limitations.  I was wondering if you would know who
    I could ask about this or if you knew if sharing without charging is ok.
    
    ᏩᏙᏛ,
    
    Tim Orr
