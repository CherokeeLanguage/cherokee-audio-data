       This textbook was created to be accessible for second language learners of the Cherokee lan-
guage. With this book, we also want to give students a sense of what it means to begin to “think in
Cherokee” instead of thinking with an English mindset.
       The lessons in this book were developed by first language Cherokee speakers and second
language learners of Cherokee by the Cherokee Language Program. It is designed to be used as a
textbook for beginning to intermediate learners of Cherokee with the challenges of learning Cherokee
as a second language in mind. It can be utilized in a formal classroom setting or it can be used as a
self-guided set of lessons. But as with learning any language, it is recommended to study with others
because language is a social activity.
       Learning to speak Cherokee requires a focus on learning the pronunciation of the sounds
and on practicing saying things aloud. This is especially important for beginners. For this reason,
this book will not focus on learning on how to read and write the Cherokee syllabary. The Cherokee
words are written out phonetically so a learner can better understand the pronunciation. A conclud-
ing epilogue in this book introduces the syllabary so that students can start practicing learning the
syllabary on their own. The syllabary will be covered more thoroughly in a future volume.
       This book has an accompanying set of audio recordings in Cherokee to go along with each
chapter. The recordings are of fluent Cherokee speakers so you can hear proper pronunciation. Any-
time you see a word or phrase colored in blue it means it has been recorded. The audio recordings can
be downloaded at www.cherokee.org/languagetech/. It should be noted that there are slight differ-
ences in spoken Cherokee among different communities in Oklahoma. A single text cannot account
for all the local variations but this book has tried to represent a cross section of the Cherokee speaking
community. A list of other reference sources for Cherokee language learning is provided at the end of
the book as well.
       The contents of this Cherokee language textbook were developed by Durbin Feeling, Patrick
Rochford, Anna Sixkiller, David Crawler, John Ross, Dennis Sixkiller, Ed Fields, Edna Jones, Lula Elk,
Lawrence Panther, Jeff Edwards, Zachary Barnes, Wade Blevins, and Roy Boney, Jr.

Prologue
Vowel and Consonant Sounds

        The first step in learning any language is to learn the sounds of that language. Not all
languages share the same sounds. Cherokee has sounds that are not found in other languages, so in
this section we will go over how to pronounce the sounds of the Cherokee language.

Vowels

     There are six vowels in the Cherokee Language. Each vowel can be either long or short,
depending on the word. The vowels are as follows:

      A as in the word “father.”
      E as in the word “egg.”
      I like the “ea” in the word “pit.”
      O as in the word “pole.”
      U like the “oo” in the word “food.”
      V like the “u” in the word “under” with a nasal quality to it.

Consonants

      Most of the consonants of Cherokee are the same or very similar to the consonants of English,
but Cherokee does not have the consonants B, C, F, P, R, V, X, and Z. Cherokee does contain a unique
consonant sound represented as “tl,” “dl,” and sometimes “hl.” More on this consonant will be
discussed below.

     Cherokee divides its consonants into 12 sounds, but some consonants have different variations
depending on the word.

      G as in the word “gone.”
              The “G” consonant can also have a “K” variation, as in the word “kind.”
      H as in the word “horse.”
      L as in the word “law.”
      M as in the word “most.”
      N as in the word “nine.”
              The “N” consonant can also have an “Hn” variation, where you allow air to exit
              through your nose as you pronounce the “N” sound. There is also a variation where an
              “h” sound, known as aspiration, appears after the vowel (nah).
      Qu as in the word “queen.”
              The “Qu” consonant can also have a “Gw” variation, as in the name “Gwen.”
              Sometimes Qu is written as Kw.
      S as in the word “saw.”
      D as in the word “dawn.”
              The “D” consonant can also have a “T” variation, as in the word “Tall.”
      W as in the word “wonder.”
              Sometimes the “W” consonant can take on an “H” sound and is written as “hw”




                                                  9
                                              ᏣᎳᎩ ᎣᏣᏕᎶᏆᎠ

       Y as in the “yard.”
              Sometimes the “Y” consonant can take on an “H” sound and is written as “hy”

Special Consonants

      Now we will discuss two “special” consonants. One possesses similar pronunciation to an
English consonant, and the other is the “tl” sound mentioned earlier.

       Ts similar to the “j” in the word “jewel.”
              “Ts” is commonly written as a “j” sound, as in the word “jewel,” but the sound isn’t
              exactly the same as a “j.” This consonant can also have a “Ch” variation, as in the
              word “chew.” For this book “J” will be used to represent the “Ts” consonant to help
              learners who are unfamiliar with the sounds of the language. Listen to carefully to the
              recordings throughout this book to hear how this sound is properly pronounced.

        “Tl” is especially difficult for non-Cherokee speakers to pronounce, but it can be easily learned
with some practice. The first step in pronouncing this sound is placing the tip of your tongue on the
roof of your mouth, like when pronouncing an “L” sound, but a bit further back. Let the air flow
around your tongue, like pronouncing an “H” sound. Then you can pronounce your vowel. As said
earlier, this consonant is also written as “hl.”

      The “dl” variation is a lot easier to pronounce. It can be learned by simply pronouncing “D”
and then immediately blend into an “L” sound before your vowel sound.

Sound Deletion

       As you will learn more about in the next section, Cherokee is a syllabic language, meaning that
every consonant needs a vowel, but there are some exceptions in when speaking the language. When
a sound can be dropped in this book, the vowel will be marked by parenthesis ( ).

       For Example:

       1.     al(i)sday(v)hdi – Time to eat

       When writing this word, every consonant has a vowel connected to it. When pronounced,
only the consonants “L” and “Y” are pronounced. With this word another sound change occurs when
vowel deletion takes effect. The “ay” will produce a sound that sounds like the word “eye.” This
sound rule is advanced and will be covered more thoroughly in a future volume.

Aspiration

       In the example above for vowel deletion, you saw that there is an “h” immediately before
the syllable “di” at the end. This is aspiration. Aspiration is the presence of a breathy sound and is
written as an “h” with no vowel attached. Aspiration is used in the consonant sounds “hw” and “hy”
mentioned earlier.

Glottal Stop

      A glottal stop is an absence of sound. It is most commonly found in Cherokee separating two
vowels that don’t have a consonant to separate them. It is marked by an apostrophe in this book.
      For Example:

      2.       go’i – grease

      In English you can hear a glottal stop when you say “uh oh.” The glottal stop is present
between the two syllables, but glottal stops can also appear in Cherokee words when there aren’t two
vowels next to each other. A glottal stop will always exist between two adjacent vowels.
      For Example:

      3.       ta’li – two

Chapter 1
Cherokee Preﬁxes
Section 1: Set A Preﬁxes

       Cherokee is classified as a polysynthetic language, meaning that each word is made of smaller
parts called morphemes. This means that one single Cherokee word can tell you the subject, verb,
and the time the action took place. All Cherokee verbs must have a pronoun prefix attached to it. A
pronoun prefix is a sound or group of sounds that attached to the front of a root word to establish
who is doing the action. A root word is a verb or noun that has no pronoun attached to it. Cherokee
has two sets of pronoun prefixes, Set A and Set B.
       Depending on the word, some will take a Set A prefix and some take Set B. It is important to
note that some verb tenses always take a Set B prefix, even if its other tenses use Set A. We will go
over tenses later on in this chapter. In this section we will focus on Set A.

       For Example:

       “Ji-“ is the pronoun prefix for first person, or I. –goliye’a is the root word for the present
       tense verb “reading it” or “looking at it.” When you combine them, you get jigoliye’a – I am
       reading/looking at it.

       All subjects will fall into 1 of 3 person categories. First person is when the speaker is referring
to himself or herself. Second person is who the speaker is talking to, almost always using the pronoun
“you.” Third person is used when discussing someone or something that is not present or part of
the conversation most usually the pronouns he, she, and it. It should be noted that Cherokee does
not have a separate pronoun for he, she, or it. It is important that you give context when using
third person in Cherokee. In Cherokee, the prefix “a-“ or “ga-“ can represent he, she, or it. To avoid
confusion, adding a noun to clear up whom is doing the action can really help when using third
person.

       For Example:

      Agoliye’a – “He, she, or it is looking at it.” Adding the words “na asgaya” will give the
pronoun prefix a gender, letting the listener know who was looking at it. Na asgaya agoliye’a – “He is
looking at it.” The literal translation of that would be “The man, he is looking at it.”

       As mentioned at the beginning of the section, a root can also be a noun. Nothing really
changes when you use a prefix with a noun, but instead of somebody doing an action, the prefix acts
as possession of the noun. Note that this is not how all nouns gain possession. This is only used on
certain nouns.

       For Example:

       1.     Aholi – Mouth

       2.     Ji’oli                      3.     Hiholi                      4.     Aholi
              My Mouth                           Your mouth                         His/her/its mouth

      You may have noticed that the word mouth and his/her/its mouth both have the same
Cherokee word. The thought behind this is it is never just a mouth. It is always someone’s or
something’s mouth.

                                                   14
                                       We Are Learning Cherokee


       Now let’s look at the different sets of pronoun prefixes. For this example we will conjugate the
root for “reading/looking at it” (-goliye’a) to each pronoun prefix.

           SET A PREFIXES (Before Consonant):
                     PERSON                          PREFIX                CONJUGATION
           I                             Ji-                          Jigoliye’a
           You                           Hi-                          Higoliye’a
           He, She, or It                A-     or   Ga-              Agoliye’a
           They                          Ani-                         Anigoliye’a
           You and I                     Ini-                         Inigoliye’a
           He or She and I               Osdi-                        Osdigoliye’a
           You Two                       Sdi-                         Sdigoliye’a
           All of Us                     Idi-                         Idigoliye’a
           They and I                    Oji-                         Ojigoliye’a
           You All                       Iji-                         Ijigoliye’a


        Third person Set A can also be shown as “ga-” prefix. The use of a- or ga- all depends on the
word.

        For Example:

        -nosgi’a is the root for the verb “is stealing it.” This verb uses ga- as its prefix. Combine them
        to get ganosgi’a – he or she is stealing it.

       Set A prefixes also change slightly if the root word begins with a vowel. We will now go over
the Set A prefixes before a vowel. For this prefix set, we will conjugate the root word “is diving”
(-adetvsga) for each prefix.

           SET A PREFIXES (Before Vowel):
                     PERSON                          PREFIX                CONJUGATION
           I                             G-                           Gadedvsga
           You                           H-                           Hadetvsga
           He, She, or It                A- or       G-               Adetvsga
           They                          An-                          Anadetvsga
           You and I                     In-                          Inadetvsga
           He or She and I               Osd-                         Osdadetvsga
           You Two                       Sd-                          Sdadetvsga
           All of Us                     Id-                          Idadetvsga
           They and I                    Oj-                          Ojadetvsga
           You All                       Ij-                          Ijadetvsga


                                                      15
                                            ᏣᎳᎩ ᎣᏣᏕᎶᏆᎠ



       Like with the Set A prefixes that come before consonants, Set A prefixes before vowels can use
“a-” and “g-” to represent third person. This can be a problem sometimes. You may have noticed
that both first and third person uses “g-” as a prefix before vowels. The next table will show the
conjugation of “understand” (-ohliga) in first and third person.

          Conjugation of Understand (-ohliga)
                   PERSON                       PREFIX                  CONJUGATION
          I                            G-                          Goliga
          He or She                    G-                          Gohl(i)ga


       You can see the difference in the conjugation. The root has aspiration between the syllables “o”
and “li.” One quality that first person prefixes possesses is the ability to remove the first aspiration
in a root. The first person conjugation then becomes goliga. However, third person does not remove
aspiration, and in the case of this word, aspiration triggers vowel deletion. The third person
conjugation becomes gohlga.
       One last prefix to touch on in Set A appears in the root word “-edoha” which means “is
walking around/here.” It follows the same rules as before when a prefix is needed with a root that
begins with a vowel, but in the case of third person, neither “a-” nor “g-” are used. Instead no prefix
is used, so the third person word says as edoha – He or she is walking around/here. This change is
triggered when a Set A root word begins with “-e.”

Cherokee Preﬁxes
Section 2: Set B Preﬁxes


       In the following charts we will go over Set B prefixes before a consonant and Set B prefixes
before a vowel. We will conjugate “hungry” (-yosiha) for the prefixes that come before a consonant
and “want” (-aduliha) for the prefixes that come before a vowel.

          SET B PREFIXES (Before Consonant):
                    PERSON                         PREFIX               CONJUGATION

       One final sound rule to mention is the difference between the third person Set B prefixes. “U-”
will replace the vowel at the beginning of the root if that vowel is an “a.” If the root begins with “e”
or “o” the prefix “uw-” will be used. If the root begins with “v” then the prefix will not be “uwv-” it
will be “uwa-” instead. If the root begins with “u,” no change will occur to the word (technically the
prefix “u-” will replace the “u” in the root word but nothing will actually change visually).


                                                    17
                                              ᏣᎳᎩ ᎣᏣᏕᎶᏆᎠ


      Set B prefixes aren’t that different from Set A, but they follow a few different rules. For
example, first person Set B does not remove aspiration. Set B can also be connected to a root noun to
express possession.

      For Example:

      1.     Eji – Mother (used when addressing your mother personally)

      2.     Agiji                       3.     Jaji                        4.     Uji
             My Mother**                        Your Mother                        His/Her Mother


Other Preﬁxes

       You will come across other prefixes when learning Cherokee. Some of these are other pronoun
prefixes, and others are not. The others are known as prepronominal prefixes (a prefix that will
attach before a pronoun prefix). You will see words later in this book that will be using these kind of
prefixes. Below are prefixes you will most likely encounter in this book, as well as in the Cherokee
world, and a description of what they mean.


        Preﬁx (Before Consonant / Before Vowel)                       Description
      De- / D-                                          Used when an action is dealing with
                                                        multiple objects.
      Wi- / W-                                          Used when distance/location is a
                                                        factor.
      Yi- / Y-                                          Used when an action may or can occur,
                                                        and is also used in negation.

      For Example:

      De- / D-

             5.     Svkta duduliha – He or She wants apples.

             6.     Digohweli dejigoliye’a – I am looking at the papers


      * These verbs will always take the de-/d- prepronominal prefix.
      **Agiji actually means “She is a mother to me.” In the Cherokee language people cannot be
      owned. The same would be applied to Jaji (She is mother to you) and Uji (She is mother to him
      or her)

Cherokee Tenses
Section 1: Present Tense

       In this chapter we will be going over six of the most common tenses. Those tenses are Present
Tense, Recent Past Tense, Imperative Tense, Habitual Tense, Progressive Future Tense, and Remote
Past Tense. First we will cover present tense.

       The present tense of a verb in Cherokee works the same way as it does in English. This verb
tense yields the meaning of an action happening “at the moment” that the speaker is talking. The
present tense suffix is marked by an “-a” ending as seen below in the examples provided.



      For Example:



      1.     Na asgaya gawoniha.                        6.    Na asgaya sdaya gawoniha.

             The man is speaking.                             The man is speaking loudly.



      2.     Analisdayvhvsga.                           7.    Ijalisdayvhvsga.

             They are eating a meal.                          You all are eating a meal.



      3.     Uwodujv’i dekanogi’a.                      8.    Danihnogi’a.

             He/she is singing very beautifully.              They are singing.



      4.     Goliga.                                    9.    Idadadolisdiha.

             I understand it.                                 We are all praying.



      5.     Unvdi gaditasga.                           10.   Wulvgw(o)dv’i kanogisdi kanogi’a

             I am drinking milk.                              He/she is singing her favorite song.

Section 2: Recent Past Tense

       The recent past tense is used when describing an event that took place during the same day
that the speaker is talking about.

The following are some examples of verbs from present tense to recent past tense.



      For Example:



      1.     Ahnigi’a                          →                   Ahnigi

             He/she is leaving                                     He/she just left



      2.     Galisdayvhvsga                    →                   Galisdayvhvga

             I am eating a meal                                    I just ate a meal



      3.     Aniwoniha                         →                   Aniwonihi

             They are speaking                                     They just spoke



      4.     Akihyoha                          →                   Agiyhiga

             I am looking for it                                   I just looked for it



      5.     Haditasga                         →                   Hadita

             You are drinking it                                   You just drank it




                                                 21

Section 3: Imperative Tense

       The imperative tense is the command form. This conjugation is formed similar to the
immediate past tense conjugation of the verb. The imperitive form is only used with second person
prefixes (you, you two, and you all).

                      VERB                        PRESENT                       IMPERATIVE
       Speak (You)                   Hiwoniha                      Hiwonihi
       You all                       Ijiwoniha                     Ijiwonihi
       You two                       Sdiwoniha                     Sdiwonihi


       Write (You)                   Hohweli’a                     Hohwelvga
       You all                       Ijohweli’a                    Ijohwelvga
       You two                       Sdohweli’a                    Sdohwelvga


       Listen (You)                  Hatvdasdiha                   Hatvdasda
       You all                       Ijatvdasdiha                  Ijatvdasda
       You two                       Sdatvdasdiha                  Sdatvdasda


       Read (You) (plural)*          Dehigoliye’a                  Tigoliya
       You all                       Dejigoliye’a                  Dijigoliya
       You two                       Desdigoliye’a                 Disdigoliya


       The prepronominal prefix for plural objects (de-/d-) is a little different when dealing with
the imperative form. The pronoun for command form is “di-” instead of “de-” and a sound rule is
triggered on second person verbs that use “hi-” as it’s pronoun. When “di-” is used with “hi-” the
two combine to create “ti-” before consonants, and “t-” before vowels.



      Before Consonants:

      “di-” + “hi-” = “ti-”



      Before vowels:

      “di-” + “h-” = “t-”



      The following example show present tense verbs becoming imperative tense verbs. You will
see words that use the “de-” and “d-” prefix in present tense become “ti-” and “t-”when the tense
change occurs. You will also see the “di-” form of the prefix on the “you two” pronoun (sdi-).

                                    We Are Learning Cherokee



      For Example:

      1.     Dehigi’a                               →                    Tiga!

             You are eating them                                         Eat them



      2.     Dehinogi’a                             →                    Tinogi!

             You are singing                                             Sing!



      3.     Osda Nidehvneha                        →                    Osda nitvga!

             You are fixing them                                         Fix them!



     Remember: The imperative form of the verb closely resembles the recent past conjugation.
Examples of these are listed below.



      4.     Desdigoliya                     →                   Disdigoliya!

             You two just read them                              You all read them!



      5.     Dehiga                          →                   Tiga!

             You just ate them                                   Eat them!



      6.     Dehatvdasdiha                   →                   Tatvdasda!

             You are listening to them                           Listen to them!



      7.     Desdinogi’a                     →                   Disdinogi!

             You two are singing                                 You (two) sing!

Section 4: Habitual Tense

The habitual tense is formed by adding the suffix “-o’i” onto the end of the verb. The habitual tense is
for an action that the person does constantly on a daily basis or more often than that. Below are some
verbs in the present tense, and their change into habitual.


      For Example:


      1.     Gawoniha                           →                    Gawonisgo’i
             He/she is speaking                                      He/she speaks (habitually)


      2.     Gadelogwa’a                        →                    Gadelogwasgo‘i
             I am learning                                           I learn


      3.     Anigoliye’a                        →                    Anigoliyesgo’i
             They are looking at it                                  They look at it


      4.     Ijaduliha                          →                    Ijadulisgo’i
             You all are wanting it                                  You all want it


      5.     Osdvhnisdiha                       →                    Osdvhnisdisgo’i
             He and I are cooking it                                 He and I cook it

Section 5: Progressive Future Tense

The progressive future tense is formed by adding the suffix “-esdi” onto the end of the verb. The
easiest way to do this is to take the habitual form of the verb being conjugated, omit the “-o’i” and
tack on the “-esdi” suffix.


       For Example:


       1.     Gawonisgo’i                          →                   Gawonisgesdi
              He speaks (habitually)                                   He will be speaking


       2.     Gadelogwasgo’i                       →                   Gadelogwasgesdi
              I learn                                                  I will be learning


       3.     Anigoliyesgo’i                       →                   Anigoliyesgesdi
              They read it                                             They will be reading it


       4.     Ijan(v)to’i                          →                   Ijanhtesdi
              You all know it                                          You all will know it


       5.     Osdvnisdisgo’i                       →                   Osdvnisdisgesdi
              He and I cook it                                         He and I will be cooking it


      The following are some example sentences using the progressive future tense. The verb has

Cherokee Tenses
Section 6: Remote Past Tense

       The remote past tense is used with any action that happened, just as a frame of reference,
around hour after the action occurred. This tense is denoted by the suffix “-v’i” on the end of the
verb. Note that when we conjugate verbs to the past tense, the pronoun prefix must also switch to Set
B pronoun prefix format.

      Kohi sanale, ugodi agwalisdayvhnv’i.
      This morning I ate a lot.

      For Example:

      1.     Gawoniha                                  →                    Uwonisv’i
             He/she is speaking.                                            He/she spoke.


      2.     Analisdayvhvsga                           →                    Unalisdayvhnv’i
             They are eating a meal.                                        They ate a meal.


      3.     Sdigoliye’a                               →                    Sdigoliye’v’i
             You two are reading it.                                        You two read it.


      4.     Gohl(i)ga                                 →                    Uwohl(i)jv’i
             He / She understands it.                                       He / She understood it.


      5.     Hinoheha                                  →                    Janohetlv’i
             You are talking about it.                                      You talked about it


The Reportive Past Tense

       The reportive past tense is used when the speaker is talking about an event in the past that he
or she did not witness. This is denoted by an “-e’i” suffix marker on the end of the verb.

      For Example:

      6.     Wahya uyotle’i, adisgv’i.                 8.     Osda dunanelohne’i, jadisgv’i.
             He shot a wolf, he said.                         She told me they played well.

      7.     Gado usdi jatvgane’i?                     9.     Ganag(a)tiju wijedole’i?
             What did you hear?                               Did you go to the doctor?

Section 4: Asking Questions

In Cherokee, there are various question marker suffixes that can be used. Below are examples of these
suffixes and in what modes they are used.



      1.     Nihi-na?

             And you?

                    -na: this question suffix means “what or how about?”

                    nihi: this is the pronoun word for “you”



      2.     Nihi-nahv?

             How about you?

                    -nahv: denotes the meaning of “but how or what about?”



      3.     Gawoni-sgohv?

             But is he speaking? (D.F. 1975)

                    -sgohv: “but is…”



      4.     Agasga-ju?

             Well, is it raining?

                    agasga - It is raining

                    -ju: is used with “yes or no questions.” (D.F. 1975)



      5.     Kahwi-s jaduliha?

             Do you want coffee?

                    -s: is a question marker that is used similar to -ju. The use of either -s or -ju is
                    sometimes determined by region. One Cherokee community may use -s,
                    while others nearby may use -ju.

Using Numbers and Time
Section 2: Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal numbers are very similar to the regular numbers in Cherokee. To make a number into an
ordinal number, most of the time you will only add the suffix -ne to the end of the word. For some
the suffix -hine (seen on 1st) and the suffix -sine (seen on 11th - 19th) needs to be added to change the
number into an ordinal.

       Note: Both sagwuhine and igvyi mean first, but sagwuhine is more commonly used when
       expressing 21st, 31st, etc.

       1.     Sagwuhine / igvyi - 1st                     12.    Tal(i)dusine - 12th



       2.     Ta’line - 2nd                               13.    Jogadusine - 13th



       3.      Jo’ine - 3rd                               14.    Nigadusine - 14th



       4.     Nvhgine - 4th                               15.    Sgigadusine - 15th



       5.     Hisgine - 5th                               16.    Daladusine - 16th

Using Numbers and Time
Section 4: Money

      For this lesson we will be going over some words and phrases dealing with counting and
buying. For the words cent (iyadan(v)tehdi) and dollar (adelv), you can put any number learned
previously to express a certain number of cents and dollars.

       In this lesson you will be introduced to the words quarter and 50 cents. Insead of saying ta’l(i)
sgoh(i) hisgi iyadan(v)tehdi for 25 cents, Cherokees just say the word for quarter, which literally
translates to one-fourth. The same goes for 50 cents. Instead of Hiksgoh(i) iyadan(v)tehdi, Cherokees
just use the word for half. You will see the word for half used in many different ways while learning
the Cherokee language. You have already seen it used in the previous lesson for expressing 1:30.

              1.     Adela                                     8.     Hiksgoh(i) adelv

Attaching Pronoun Preﬁxes To Nouns

       In Cherokee, pronoun prefixes are attached to a noun just as they are in a verb. Pronouns are
not separated from the noun and verb as they are in English. The following examples will begin to
demonstrate how to attach set A and set B prefixes onto nouns.

      Set A Preﬁxes:

                    25.    A-ganakti           —>            He/she is a doctor

                    26.    Ji-ganakti          —>            I am a doctor

                    27.    Ani-ganakti         —>            They are doctors

                    28.    Hi-ganakti          —->           You are a doctor



                    29.    A-yvwi              —>            A person or He/she is a person

                    30.    Ji-yvwi             —>            I am a person

                    31.    Hi-yvwi             —>            You are a person

                    32.    Ani-yvwi             —>           They are people



      Set B Preﬁxes:

                    33.    U-gvwiyuhi           —>           He/she is a chief/president

                    34.    Agi-gvwiyuhi        —>            I am a chief/president

                    35.    Ja-gvwiyuhi         —>            You are a chief/president

                    36.    Uni-gvwiyuhi         —>           They are chiefs/presidents

Animate

      For words using set A pronoun prefixes, we use “An-” before consonants and “Ani-” before
      consonants.

• In Cherokee, some plants are classified as being alive, thus they are given the animate plural
  prefix. As is the case with the word “osda,” used to describe the physical qualities of an item of
  food.
• Sometimes animals are not given the regular plural prefixes when talking about more than one
  animal. Rather, the adjectives, adverbs and verbs used in the context to discuss them are modified
  to show pluralization of the object.
• When words such as “uwoduhi” and “utana” are pluralized in their animate forms, J- or Ju- will
  have to be applied. For example:

             11.    Uwodujv agehya                     —>           Junodujv anigehya

                    A very pretty woman                             Very pretty women

             12.    Utana yona a’i.                    —>           Jun(a)tana yona ana’i.
                    A big bear is walking.                          Big bears are walking.

Inanimate

             The “di-” plural prefix is affixed to nouns, adjectives and adverbs
             For words using set B pronoun prefixes we use “J-”

             13.    Uhyvdli                    —>                   J-uhyvdli

Section 8: Negation


       We will now discuss negation, which will use the prepronominal prefix “yi-” mentioned in
Section 3. In order to negate, you will need to learn and use the Cherokee word for no.

      Tla / Vtla
      No

      This word combined with y- before vowels and yi- before consonant on verbs negates the
sentence. Tla + y- / yi- + verb = negative statement in the present.

      For Example:

             1.     Tla yijiwoniha.
                    I am not speaking.

             2.     Tla yagwaduliha.
                    I do not want it.

       When negating words that are not verb-based, the word “yigi” will be used after the word that
will be negated.

      For Example:

             3.     Junhsdi.                          →            Tla junhsdi yigi.
                    They are small.                                They are not small.

             4.     Jalagi gawonisgi.                 →            Tla jalagi gawonisgi yigi.
                    He is a Cherokee speaker.                      He is not a Cherokee Speaker.

       Negative non-verb statements in the past will use the word “yigese’i” the same way as “yigi”
is used in present tense.

      For Example:

             5.     Osda gesv’i.                      →            Tla osda yigese’i.
                    It was good.                                   It wasn’t good.

             6.     Nvya utana gese’i.                →            Tla nvya utana yigese’i.
                    The rock was big.                              The rock wasn’t big.

      Negative sentences in the future will use the word “yigesesdi” the same way the as present
used “yigi” and past used “yigese’i”

      For Example:

             7.     Osda gesesdi.                     →            Tla osda yigesesdi.
                    It will be good.                               It won’t be good.

       There is a small rule change when you are negating a verb that is using the second person Set
A prefix. When the prefix “yi-” combines with the pronoun prefix “hi-” the prefixes combine to form
“hyi-.” The second person pronoun becomes aspiration on the negation prefix.

      For Example:

             8.     Hiwonihaju?                       →            Tla hyiwoniha.
                    Are you speaking?                              You are not speaking.

Section 9: Grammar Concept (-ka and -gi)

      “-ka” is used on the end of words or verbs to render the meaning of “isn’t it?” in Cherokee.

      Examples: -ka

             1.    Vsgi-ka?                           3.    Gitli’ka gese’i?

                   Isn’t that it?                           It was a dog, right?



             2.    Gawoniha’ka?                       4.    Jalagi gawonisgi, doka?

                   Isn’t he speaking?                       He/she is a Cherokee speaker, right?

__________________________________________________________________________________________

       “-gi” is added on the end of words and/or verbs to signify asking someone to repeat what
they said. Like “what were you saying again?”

      Examples: -gi

             5.    Gado’gi hadisge?                   7.    Aya’gi?

                   What were you saying, again?             Me?



             6.    Yona’gi, hada?                     8.    Hadlvgi?

                   Did you say “Yona.”                      Where? (again)

Section 5: Grammar Concept: (-ega)

                        The verb sufﬁx that means “Going Somewhere.”

Rules for use

            Attaching “-ega” to the past tense of the verb will produce the meaning of “going
            somewhere to do something.”

            So take the remote past suffix and cut the “-v’i” off and add “-ega.”



      Examples:



      1.    Dagilvwisdanelv’i          becomes —>           Dagilvwisdanel-ega

            I worked.                                       I am going to work.



      2.    Agwalsdayvhnv’i            becomes —>           Galisdayvhn-ega

            I ate a meal.                                   I am going to eat a meal.



      3.    Unasuhnv’i                 becomes —>           Anasuhn-ega

            They fished.                                    They are going to fish.

Epilogue:
The Cherokee Syllabary




        This chart shows the Cherokee syllabary, the writing system invented by Sequoyah. His
original design was in a cursive handwritten style and was much different than what is shown above.
When Cherokee Nation wanted to print the Cherokee Phoenix newspaper in the Cherokee langauge
in the 1820s, the syllabary was modified from cursive handwriting to print, similar to how English
handwriting looks different from what is printed in books. Some syllabary characters kept some
features from Sequoyah’s original cursive version when they were modifed, but others are completely
different. Carving the cursive syllabary onto tiny metal blocks needed for the printing press difficult
and costly, and it would have resulted in legibility issues for printing. The modified version was
easier to manufacture, and the use of serifs (small lines that stopped the ink from running, as seen on
the top of the syllabary character Ꮜ, for example) made it possible for the Cherokee language to be
successfully used in print.
        The layout of the syllabary chart follows an order similar to English alphabetical order. It was
created to help the non-Cherokee speakers who worked at the printing press to easily find the correct
characters. The very top row contains the six vowels (a, e, i, o, u, v). Every subsequent row starts with
the consonant sounds. For example, the second row will take on the “G” and “K” sounds (ga, ka, ge,
gi, go, gu, gv). The vowels will always stay the same as you go from row to row with the only change
being the consonant that comes before it. Reading and writing of the syllabary will be introduced in
subsequent volumes in this series. However, please feel free to start studying the syllabary on your
own as well.
